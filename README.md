# Procedure to insert images in a Pronto Messgae List
1. Images must be resized to the dimensions you want. Ensure the file size is small so they load fast. Save them in png format.
2. Upload the image by clicking on [*Add file*](https://github.com/PsychModeling/pronto-media/upload/main)
3. Once uploaded, click on [*Code*](https://github.com/PsychModeling/pronto-media) and click on the image's listing in the repo.
4. Right click on the image itself to get the public address of the image.
5. Paste this url into the image URL on Pronto and add "?raw=true" after the extension
